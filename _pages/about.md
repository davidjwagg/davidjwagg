# Bio


David Wagg is Professor of Nonlinear Dynamics at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/mac/people/mech-eng-academic-staff/david-wagg). His research interests are focused on the dynamics and control of engineering  systems including the design and implementation of digital twins. He is a member of the [Dynamics and Control Research Group](https://drg.ac.uk) and leads the [Digital Twinning Special Interest Group](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/machine-intelligence/community/interest-groups/digital-twinning) which is part of the [Centre for Machine Intelligence](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/machine-intelligence).

Since November 2022, David has been part-seconded to the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) in London where he is developing the AI and data science aspects of [digital twins](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/tric-dt).

Prior to his appointment at the University of Sheffield, David was based at the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Bristol (2000-2013). From 2004-2009 he was an EPSRC Advanced Research Fellow. He was awarded his PhD from University College London in 1998.

# Research interests
David's current research activities include developing techniques for the design, implementation and interoperation of digital twins. Quantifying uncertainties within a dynamic digital twin context is a major topic of interest, that relates to the overall objective of validation of digital twin outputs. In addition, using ontological knowledge models for interoperation of digital twins is also an active area of interest. A recent preprint describes our thoughts on the [philosophical foundations of digital twinning](https://engrxiv.org/preprint/view/3500).

David is also leading the [Digital Twinning NetworkPlus (DTNet+)](https://www.dtnetplus.ac.uk/) a multi-disciplinary UK-wide network with research interests that is aiming to transform the UKâ€™s national capability in digital twinning.  The remit of DTNet+ spans across the entire domain of UKRI research and will explore the human, societal, legal, and ethical aspects of digital twins.  The project is funded by UKRI until July 2028.
